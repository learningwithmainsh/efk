# EFK Stack Deployment on Kubernetes

This repository contains all the necessary files and helper code for deploying the Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, and Kibana (EFK) stack on a Kubernetes cluster. The repository is organized into three main folders:

- `elasticsearch-kibana`

- `fluentbit`

- `webapp`

## Folder Structure

### elasticsearch-kibana

This folder includes configurations and manifests for deploying Elasticsearch and Kibana on Kubernetes. Elasticsearch is used for storing and searching log data, while Kibana provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and analyzing the logs.

### fluentbit

This folder contains configurations for Fluent Bit, which is used to collect, parse, and forward logs from Kubernetes pods to Elasticsearch.

### webapp

This folder includes a sample web application used to generate logs for testing the EFK stack.
