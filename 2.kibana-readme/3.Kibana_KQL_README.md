# Kibana Query Language (KQL) - README

## Overview
Kibana Query Language (KQL) is a simple and powerful query language designed for filtering and searching data within Elasticsearch using Kibana. It provides a user-friendly syntax to perform structured searches without requiring knowledge of Lucene Query Syntax.

## Key Features
- **Simple and Intuitive Syntax**
- **Auto-Completion in Kibana**
- **Supports Wildcards, Boolean Operations, and Range Queries**
- **Field-Specific Searching**
- **Efficient Filtering for Large Datasets**

## Basic Syntax

### 1. Searching for a Specific Value
```kql
field_name: "value"
```
Example:
```kql
status: "active"
```

### 2. Boolean Operators
KQL supports `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators.
```kql
field1: "value1" AND field2: "value2"
field1: "value1" OR field2: "value2"
NOT field: "value"
```
Example:
```kql
status: "active" AND category: "electronics"
```

### 3. Wildcards
Use `*` for multiple characters and `?` for a single character.
```kql
name: "Jo*"
email: "user?@domain.com"
```

### 4. Range Queries
To search for values within a range, use `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
```kql
age >= 18 AND age <= 65
price > 100
```
Example:
```kql
timestamp >= "2024-01-01T00:00:00" AND timestamp <= "2024-12-31T23:59:59"
```

### 5. Grouping Queries
Use parentheses `()` to group conditions.
```kql
(status: "active" OR status: "pending") AND category: "clothing"
```

### 6. Exists Query
To check if a field exists in the dataset.
```kql
_exists_: field_name
```
Example:
```kql
_exists_: email
```

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Nested Field Queries
If fields are nested within JSON documents, use `dot notation`.
```kql
user.name: "John Doe"
```

### 2. Filtering in Visualizations
KQL is commonly used in Kibana visualizations to refine search results for dashboards.

## Limitations
- KQL does not support regular expressions.
- It only works within Kibana and does not function in raw Elasticsearch queries.
- Unlike Lucene, it does not allow fuzzy searches.

## Conclusion
KQL simplifies searching in Kibana with an easy-to-understand syntax, making it efficient for filtering and analyzing Elasticsearch data. For more advanced queries, Lucene syntax can be used alongside KQL where necessary.
