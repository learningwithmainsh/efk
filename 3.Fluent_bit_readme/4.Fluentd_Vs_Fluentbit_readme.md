# Fluentd vs Fluent Bit

Fluentd and Fluent Bit are both log processors that help collect, filter, and forward logs efficiently. While they share similarities, they have distinct differences that make them suitable for different use cases.

## 1. Overview

### Fluentd
- **Purpose**: A full-featured log aggregator that supports high customizability and extensibility.
- **Developed by**: Treasure Data
- **Written in**: Ruby with some C extensions
- **Best for**: Large-scale data processing and enterprise-level logging solutions.

### Fluent Bit
- **Purpose**: A lightweight and high-performance log processor optimized for resource-constrained environments.
- **Developed by**: The Fluentd team (under the Fluent ecosystem)
- **Written in**: C
- **Best for**: Edge computing, IoT devices, and Kubernetes logging with minimal resource consumption.

## 2. Key Differences

| Feature         | Fluentd | Fluent Bit |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Performance** | Moderate (higher CPU & memory usage) | High (lightweight & low memory footprint) |
| **Installation Size** | ~40MB+ | ~1MB |
| **Language** | Ruby with C extensions | C |
| **Plugins & Extensibility** | 1000+ plugins available | Limited but growing plugins |
| **Use Case** | Centralized logging, data processing, and analysis | Lightweight log forwarding and filtering |
| **Kubernetes Integration** | Requires additional configuration | Optimized for Kubernetes environments |
| **Scalability** | Suitable for large-scale environments | Best for lightweight deployments |
| **Reliability** | High | Medium (designed for forwarding, not storing logs) |
| **Configuration Format** | Fluentd configuration files (td-agent) | Fluent Bit configuration files (fluent-bit.conf) |

## 3. When to Use Which?

### Use Fluentd if:
- You need a full-featured logging system with rich filtering, buffering, and output options.
- You require advanced data transformations and processing before forwarding logs.
- You are dealing with large-scale data aggregation and analysis.

### Use Fluent Bit if:
- You need a lightweight, high-performance log processor for forwarding logs.
- You are deploying logs in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, IoT, or Kubernetes clusters.
- You require simple filtering and routing without extensive processing.

## 4. Installation

### Fluentd Installation (Docker):
```sh
 docker run -d -p 24224:24224 -p 24224:24224/udp fluent/fluentd:latest
```

### Fluent Bit Installation (Docker):
```sh
 docker run -d -p 2020:2020 fluent/fluent-bit:latest
```

## 5. Conclusion
Both Fluentd and Fluent Bit serve as excellent log processing tools, but the choice depends on the use case. If you need a fully-fledged log processing system, go with **Fluentd**. If you need a lightweight, fast, and efficient log forwarder, **Fluent Bit** is the right choice.
