# Fluent Bit Plugins: Input, Filter, and Output

Fluent Bit is a lightweight and high-performance log processor and forwarder. It collects, processes, and routes logs efficiently with its plugin-based architecture.

## 1. Input Plugins
Input plugins in Fluent Bit are responsible for collecting logs from different sources.

### Common Input Plugins:
- **Tail**: Reads and monitors log files.
- **Forward**: Accepts logs from Fluentd forwarders.
- **TCP/UDP**: Receives logs over TCP/UDP.
- **Syslog**: Captures system logs.
- **Exec**: Runs a command and collects its output.
- **Journal**: Reads logs from systemd journal.

### Example Configuration:
```ini
[INPUT]
    Name        tail
    Path        /var/log/app.log
    Tag         app_logs
    DB          /var/log/flb.db
    Read_from_head true
```

## 2. Filter Plugins
Filter plugins are used to modify or enrich logs before forwarding them.

### Common Filter Plugins:
- **Parser**: Parses unstructured logs into structured format.
- **Modify**: Modifies log records (add/remove fields).
- **Record Modifier**: Adds new key-value pairs to logs.
- **Throttling**: Controls the log flow rate.
- **Grep**: Filters logs based on regex patterns.

### Example Configuration:
```ini
[FILTER]
    Name          modify
    Match         app_logs
    Add           environment production
```

## 3. Output Plugins
Output plugins define where to send the processed logs.

### Common Output Plugins:
- **Elasticsearch**: Sends logs to an Elasticsearch cluster.
- **Kafka**: Forwards logs to Apache Kafka.
- **Loki**: Sends logs to Grafana Loki.
- **HTTP**: Sends logs via HTTP requests.
- **Stdout**: Prints logs to the console (useful for debugging).

### Example Configuration:
```ini
[OUTPUT]
    Name        elasticsearch
    Match       app_logs
    Host        elasticsearch.local
    Port        9200
    Index       logs-app
```

## Conclusion
Fluent Bit provides a powerful way to collect, process, and forward logs using its flexible plugin system. By utilizing input, filter, and output plugins effectively, you can build a robust log processing pipeline tailored to your needs.
