# Scaling Elasticsearch Cluster & Recommendations

## Overview
This guide outlines how to scale an Elasticsearch cluster and includes recommendations for improving performance, resilience, and efficiency. Scaling Elasticsearch properly ensures that it handles high traffic, large datasets, and provides high availability across multiple nodes.

## Scaling Elasticsearch Cluster

### Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (CPU, memory, disk space) of the existing Elasticsearch nodes.

#### Recommendations:
- **Memory**: Allocate as much memory as possible to Elasticsearch nodes, ensuring that heap size is no more than 50% of available RAM (up to 30 GB).
- **CPU**: Ensure that Elasticsearch nodes are running on machines with sufficient CPU power to handle large query loads.
- **Disk I/O**: Use high-performance SSDs for Elasticsearch storage to ensure fast read/write operations.

### Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling involves adding more nodes to the cluster to distribute the load.

#### Recommendations:
- **Add Data Nodes**: Add additional data nodes to distribute the storage and query load.
- **Master Nodes**: Have dedicated master nodes (minimum of 3) to maintain cluster health and prevent single points of failure.
- **Client Nodes**: Use dedicated client nodes for routing queries and load balancing across data nodes.

## Elasticsearch Cluster Sizing

Determine the number of nodes required based on factors such as the data size, query volume, and retention period.

- **Data Nodes**: Typically, you'll want to add data nodes in multiples of three for fault tolerance.
- **Storage**: Monitor the disk usage and avoid reaching more than 85% of disk capacity.
- **Heap Size**: Set the JVM heap size to 50% of the available RAM, but limit it to 30GB.

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### Hardware Recommendations
- **CPU**: Use multi-core processors to handle the parallel operations Elasticsearch performs.
- **RAM**: Allocate enough RAM to store indices in memory for faster queries. As a rule of thumb, Elasticsearch nodes should have 64 GB or more.
- **Disk**: Use SSDs to ensure high I/O performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Sharding Strategy
- **Sharding**: Choose an optimal number of primary shards based on the dataset size. Too many shards can cause overhead, while too few may not scale well. The default is 5 shards, but adjust based on data size.
- **Shard Size**: Try to keep each shard under 50 GB. For very large datasets, use index splitting or rollovers.

### Replicas
- **Replicas**: Set the number of replicas to at least 1 for high availability. Replicas ensure fault tolerance, providing backup copies of your data in case of node failures.

### Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)
- Use **ILM** to automate index management, including:
  - Rolling over old indices.
  - Automatically deleting outdated indices.
  - Moving older indices to colder storage (e.g., less expensive disks).

### Monitoring
- Use **Elastic Stack Monitoring** (e.g., Kibana, Elastic Agent) to track cluster health, node performance, and query performance.
- Set up **alerting** for issues like high disk usage, high query latency, or failed nodes.

### Snapshot and Backup
- Regularly take **snapshots** of your Elasticsearch indices to ensure data recovery in case of failure.
- Store snapshots in a remote location (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for disaster recovery.

## Conclusion
Scaling your Elasticsearch cluster involves a combination of vertical and horizontal scaling to meet performance, availability, and storage requirements. By following best practices, tuning hardware resources, and implementing good cluster management techniques (e.g., ILM, monitoring, and snapshots), you can ensure that your Elasticsearch cluster scales efficiently and remains robust under heavy load.
